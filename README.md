highlights from "Managing Humans" by Michael Lopp

# The Management Quiver

## Managers Are Not Evil

There are genuinely evil and mean people who put themselves before their team, who lie, and who have absolutely no ability to lead.

The act of delegation is a slippery slope for managers.  Yes, you want to figure out how not to be a bottleneck in your organization and, yes, you want to figure out how to scale, but you also want to continue to get your hands dirty.

Real work is visible action (which) managers take to support their particular vision for their organization.  The question you need to answer for your manager is simple: does he do what he says he's going to do? Does he make something happen?

He hasn't truly represented the company until he actively participates in the constructive deconstruction of an organization.  There is no more pure panic than a layoff, and you want to see who your manager will become because it's often the first time he sees the organization is bigger than the people.

Question #1: Where did I come from?  Being able to relate to those you manage comes from intimately understanding their job.  It allows you to speak their language.  Question #2: Where am I going? A plan for your manager's next big move is his incentive.  It puts him in the uncomfortable position of trying to discern the murky political motivations of the major influencers of your company.

Why do you care that your boss wants to be VP of software?  You care because his success is your success.  If he doesn't know that, he might be evil.

## 3. Stables and Volatiles

Stables are the engineers who are known for their calm reliability.

Volatiles are the engineers who leave a trail of disruption in their wake.

I'm of the opinion that many successful Stables used to be Volatiles and are recovering from their last war.

I believe a healthy company that wants to continue to grow and invest needs to invest equally in both their Stables and their Volatiles.

## 4. The Rands Test

### Do you have a consistent one-on-one where you talk about topics other than status?

I'm of the opinion that when it hits the fan, the last thing you want to do is reschedule one-on-one time with the folks who either are responsible for it hitting the fan or are the most qualified to figure out how to prevent future fan hittage.

The point (of a one-on-one) is to have a conversation about something of substance.

### Do you have a consistent team meeting similar to one-on-one meetings?

A team meeting is a chance for everyone on the team to figure out what is the truth and what is a lie.

Did we make tangible progress on something of significance?

A team meeting is a great place to identify what is broken and start to discuss how to fix it.

### Are handwritten status reports delivered weekly via e-mail?

If you are doing this you lose a point.

If you're a software engineer, I'm guessing you use version control, bug tracking, wikis, CRM, Slack, and/or project management software.  All of these tools already automagically generate a significant amount of status regarding what has tactically gone down each week.

Well, what I really want is your high-level assessment of the week.  Three things that are working, three things that aren't, and what we're going to do about it. (just put that at the beginning of the one-on-one)

### Are you comfortable saying "no" to your boss?

I believe that leaders who think they're infallible slowly go insane with power created by the lie that being wrong is a sign of weakness.

### Can you explain the strategy of your company to a stranger?

I (Gavin) think the strategy at SOCi is to provide many tools to businesses which help them monitor and manage their reputation with their customers.  We try to learn and integrate the latest technologies into the platform in order to reduce costs for our customer.  Specifically, we are interested in using more automation and improving the user experience.

### Can you tell me with some accuracy the state of the business?

If the executives can't successfully predict the state of their business, something is wrong.

### Is there a regular meeting where the guy/gal in charge gets up in front of everyone and tells you what he/she is thinking?  Are you buying it?

Directors, leads, and managers - these folks tend to stay close to current events because it's increasingly their job, but it's also their job to take steps to keep the information flowing, and it starts with the CEO.

### Can you explain your career trajectory?  Can your boss?

I (Gavin) need to read more and learn more.  I need to have a learning plan and the discipline to execute on my learning plan as if I were back in school.  I am very interested in learning more about process improvement for agile software engineering teams.  And I want to one day lead many teams of remote software engineers.

### Do you have well-defined and protected time to be strategic?

If you have time in which you're investing in yourself while at work, and your boss is cool with it - give yourself a point.

### Are you actively killing the Grapevine?

Rumors hate to justify themselves, so give yourelf a point if you make it a point to kill gossip.

## How to Run a Meeting

I bag on meetings because, like any nerd, I expect the universe to be efficient and orderly, and there is no more vile a volition of this sense of orderliness than a room full of people randomly bumping into shit and calling it a meeting.

A conversation is a simple negotiation: make a point, get a response, retort, retort back.

When you have more than two people the conversation now becomes a meeting, and the core difference between a conversation and a meeting is that it needs rules so people know when to talk.

A meeting has two critical components: an agenda and a referee.

All active participants in a meeting can instinctively sense progress, and when progress isn't being made, they get cranky and sgtart looking for the exit.  A referee's job is to shape the meeting to meet the requirements of the agenda and the expectations of the participants.  Style and execution vary wildly from referee to referee, but the defining characteristics are the perceptions of the meeting participants.

It is the responsibility of the referee to constantly surf the room visually to determine who is and isn't engaged.  This is hard.

Summoning the dictator is a last-ditch effort geared at fixing the problem right now, but in such a way that the problem doesn't show up again.

The solution to whatever the hard problem might be is going to show up via one of two things: random brilliance or grindingly hard work.

Meeting management, like people management, is often the art of managing a moment, which means that the only rule that applies is entirely dependent on the snowflake-like context of the moment.

## The Twinge

Listen all the time and use your experience to detect disasters before they occur.

There is no way you're doing it all.  You need to trust and you need to delegate.

These new managgers initially believe the essential skills of building that made them successful as engineers will apply to the building of people, but they don't.  It's their experience that matters.

As a manager, think of your day as one full of stories.

As a story is being told to you, the opinion of the storyteller is affecting both the content and the tone.  Their agenda dictates what they are choosing to tell you.

My belief is that my brain is far better at subconscious analysis, pattern matching, and teasing out apparently essential details from the noise than I'll consciously ever be.  My belief is that my experiences drive my sometimes subconscious instincts, and this is why I've come to trust the Twinge.

## The Update, the Vent, and the Disaster

Understand that each time you bail on a one-on-one, theperson you're managing hears, "You don't matter."

### How Are You?

The content is nerely a delivery vehicle for the mood, and the mood sets your agenda (Update, Vent, or Disaster).

### The Update

Fallback to "Talking points regarding your team", "The mini-performance review", or "My current disaster".  We want to avoid project status.

A productive one-on-one is one where we talk strategically about how we do stuff, but more importantly, how we might do this stuff better.

### The Vent

When the Vent begins, you might confuse this for a conversation. It's not. It's a mental release valve, and your job is to listen for as long as it takes. Don't problem solve. Don't redirect. Don't comfort. Yet. Your employee is doing mental house cleaning, and interrupting this cleaning is missing the point. They don't want a solution; they want to be heard.

At its core, the Vent is motivagted by emotion.

### The Disaster

If a Vent feels like a speech, a Disaster feels like an attack.

As with the Vent, success comes with traversing the emotional explosion.

When your employee believes totally losing their shit is a productive strategy, it's because they believe it's the only option left for making anything change.

### Assume They Have Something to Teach You

You'll see when interest in a project begins to wane and take action before it becomes job dissatisfaction.

## The Monday Freakout

Properly timed and well-constructed questions lead your freak away from emotion because they force them to the other side of their brain where they don't freak, they think.

The key with a question offense is to move your freak from the emotional state to the rational one.

One pleasant side effect of attacking freakouts with questions is that you discover the freak is often already close to a solution. Remember, they've been simmering since Friday and, in that time, they've been chewing on the problem from every angle possible. In that time, their understanding while soaked in emotion has more depth than yours.

It's great that your freak has chosen to freak out. The alternative is that they're not saying a thing and have decided to leave the company.

A problem to solve is that someone believes the best way to get your attention is by freaking out.

## Lost in Translation

Whenever I say something that might be ambiguous, I ask, "What did you hear?" In return, when I'm listening, and the topic or intent is not abundantly clear, I restate: "OK, what I heard was ..."

When communications are down, listen hard, repeat everything, and assume nothing.

## Agenda Detection

Chances are you're either in an informational meeting or a conflict resolution meeting.

Inconflict resolutionmeetings, there are players and pawns.  And among the players there are pros and cons.  If you dont' have players, then you don't have a meeting.  If you don't have pros and cons, then you don't have a meeting.

Someone needs to synthesize everything into a constructive next steps and communicate that to the cons, and then you're done.

You don't need to know what they're saying because with agenda detection, you can figure out who they are, what they want, get it for them, and get the hell out.

## Dissecting the Mandate

In your quiver of management skills, you've got a couple of powerful arrows.  There's the annual review, where you take the time to really exlain, in detail, what a given employee needs to do to grow.  That's huge.  That can be life changing.  That's a big arrow.  How about the layoff?  That's when you get asked who stays and who goes.  You're going to lose some sleep when you've got to pull the bow back on that one.  Then there's the mandate.  The mandage is when you gather the team together and calmly say, "This is the way it is." No Q&A. No collaboration. It's your dictate handed down from on high.

Rule of thumb: when the debate is no longer productive, it's time to make a decision.

I will say that if you don't spend time considering both sides of the issue before you deliver, then your team will know it and your credibility will be suspect.

A good sign of poor mandate delivery is when the delivery degrades into another debate of the issues.

Delivering (again) is taking the time to individually express your reasoning to the concerned parties - both the winners and the losers.

Regarding foreign mandates, regardless of what your opinion is, you must figure out the justification behind the mandate.

## Information Starvation

One of your many jobs as manager is information conduit, and the rules are deceptively simple: for each piece of informatino you see, you must correctly determine who on your team needs that piece of information to do their job.

Perhaps the biggest loss of essential information is when managers rely on their brains as to-do lists.

The good news is, if you're never wondering what your team heard or read when you pass on your information, you can ask one of my favorite follow-up questions: "What did you just hear?"

In my staff meetings, I throw in the occasional long pause.

## Subtlety, Subterfuge, and Silence

Now, the point of a performance review is not the review itself but the conversation that stems from it.

Subtlety starts with humility. Exhibiting your power and knowledge as a manager isn't always the best method of communicating.

The use of subterfuge for good means keeping the intent honest. If you're going commando to do what you believe is right, it doesn't mean someone isn't going to be pissed, but i should allow you to sleep at night.

My natural state is one of introspection where I'm soaking in the world, and the skill has taken me far because so many folks out there just can't shut up.

Remember this: in most businesses, everyone's basic agenda is visible after they've talked for about 30 seconds.

## Managementese

One o fmy favorite books on software construction is Steve McConnell's "Code Complete".

As a manager, your job is that of a bullshit umbrella. You need to decide what crap your team needs to deal with and what crap can be ignored.

## You're Not Listening

Let's start with the most basic rule of listening: If they don't trust you, they aren't going to say shit.

It's simple, it's trivial, but attention is defined by eye contact.

Each time you successfully sit down and give someone else your full attention, the attention contract gradually evolves.

Be a curious fool. This is a restatement of advice I gave in prior chapter: "Assume they have somehting to teach you."

Being a curious fool means talking about things that appear to have no substantive value to the conversation or the business - that's ok.

A conversation without clarification and segues is an exhausting circular exercise where two people are working increasingly hard at not understanding what the other is saying and failing to get to the point.

Listening is work, and the difference between listening well and making them feel like you're selling them a car has to do with intent.

## Fred Hates the Off-Site

I believe that each time your company double sin size, it needs to reinvent how it communicates, and each subsequent transformation ins increasingly radical and foreign.

You need someone running the show who has skin in the game.

The successful off-site is one that maps the discoveries of the off-site to the reality of the work. Bright-and-shiny inflection points are full of energy, but unless that energy is carefully channeled back into the building and immediately acted upon, all an off-site represents is a frustrating opportunity to dream, but not to act.

## A Different Kind of DNA

We don't have a good idea how to systematically grow engineers outside the traditional management hierarchy.

The perspective "I can't yell at you because you sign the checks" is based on a change of ownership and responsibility.

We need leads and managers as a means of scaling responsibility and communication, but we need to dispel the idea that their roles are also the exclusive owners of decision-making.

**DNA stands for design 'n' architecture.  It's a meeting of bright engineers from across the team or the company tasked with deep analysis regarding decisions and directions core to the product.**

First, the rule for all attendees in a DNA meeting is, if you don't contribute, you won't be invited back.

The end result of a healthy DNA meeting will have members of the receiving team sitting with their heads squarely planted on their desks, whispering, "Oh shit, I can't believe we didn't think of that."

Pure managers are not considered for the team, because DNA is about cultivating technical leadership.

A DNA meeting is a staff meeting of the influential engineers who don't want direct reports, but want to lead.

You build a DNA meeting so your technical leaders have a platform where their ideas are heard, debated, and acted on. You build a DNA meeting to remind the team that all forms of leadership matter.

## An Engineering Mindset

My advice is that you take action so that you stay in touch with how your team builds stuff.

Be familiar with your team's tools, including the build system, version control, and programming language(s).

Be able to draw a detailed architectural diagram describing your product on any whiteboard at any time.

Own a small feature or fix some bugs.

Write unit tests.

## Tear It Down

The focus of The Lead is the team - this is their entire world.

THe Leads of Leads rae running the company.  They are middle management.

The Director's job is to figure out how the company fits into and interacts with the rest of the world.

It's hard to tell if the Director is crazy batshit insane or crazy batshit inspired.

WHen I ask "How many of you are leaders?" I want the whole room to raise their hands because I know leadership comes from everywhere.

## Titles Are Toxic

Titles started out as a means to give folks a path toward growth.

Phil's title should be Humble Math-Addled Keeper of the Peace whereas Felix's would be The Dark Lord of Performance and Snark.  Their jobs are clearly as engineers, but defining a single title is a slippery exercise when comparing two things that are incomparable.

Regardin solutions, Lopp believes there is a glimmer of a good idea regarding gauging and announcing ability in ides like Open Badges.

Push your folks into uncomfortable situations in which they'll learn, documdent, and reocgnize their accomplishments, and then help them recovdr from their failures as quickly as possible.

## Saying No

Managers lose it when they are no longer questioned in their decisions.

The ability to strategically choose when it's time to stop is the sign of a manager willing to defy convention.

As a manager, you are responsible for making great decisions and the best way to do that is to involve as much of the team as possible in every decision.
